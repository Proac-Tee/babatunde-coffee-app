# Coffee Shop Full Stack

This is a digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

The application details includes:

1. Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2. Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3. Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4. Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
